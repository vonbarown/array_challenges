# array_challenges
// This is a series of coding challenges on the w3school on arrays
//Write a function add that adds an element to the end of an array. However, the element should only be added if it is not already in the array. add([1, 2], 3) should return [1, 2, 3] and add([1, 2], 2) should return [1, 2].
